üõ†Ô∏è Features

1. Ping Test
   
 Send ICMP echo requests to a specified host to check connectivity.

‚Ä¢	Function: ping_test(host, count)

‚Ä¢	Usage: Sends 4 ping requests (default) to the given host.

2. DNS Resolution
   
 Resolve a domain name to its corresponding IP address.
 
‚Ä¢	Function: dns_resolution(domain)

‚Ä¢	Usage: Useful to test DNS response and verify resolution.
________________________________________
3. Traceroute

 Track the path that a packet takes to reach the destination host.
 
‚Ä¢	Function: traceroute(host)

‚Ä¢	Usage: Identifies intermediate hops to a target address.
________________________________________
4. Port Scanner
   
 Scans a host for open or closed TCP ports.

‚Ä¢	Function: port_scan(host, ports)

‚Ä¢	Default Ports Scanned: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
________________________________________
5. Internet Connectivity Check
   
 Verifies if the system can access the internet.
 
‚Ä¢	Function: check_internet()

‚Ä¢	Usage: Pings Google (https://www.google.com) to determine connectivity.
